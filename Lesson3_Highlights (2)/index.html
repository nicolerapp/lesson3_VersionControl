            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning Control System, or VCS, automatically notes who changed the fils, when the files were changed, what about the files was new or different, and it merges changes to the same file. Some benefits of the VCS is that files cannot be overwritten, as well as that there is a common repository that holds all the latest files. In addition, Versioning Control System allow people to work on the same files simultaneously without conflict and allows them to revert back to an older version of the file if needed. Finally, even if people dont work with a team, the VSC will backup files so that they won't lose their work or have to start a project over.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning control solves the file sharing problem. The way it works is that team members check files out, make changes, and then check them back in. It is one main repository for all of the project files. Version control is the management of changes to documents, compute programs, large websites, and other collections of information. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the codeine a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed efficiency. People use GIT because there is no single point of failure, processes run much faster, everything is local, so you can work often, every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine, and Git will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. Git outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has many basic commands. One of the initial commands is “git config”, which sets configurations values for your user name, email, gig key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats and more. Another basic command is “git init”, which initializes a git repository and creates the initial ‘.git’ directory in a new or in an existing project. Another Git command is “git commit”, which takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it, and sets the branch point to that new commit. There is a plethora of Git commands, but these are the most basic and most common commands.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is an on-disk structure which stores metadata for a set of files and/or directory structure. Depending on whether the version control system in use is distributed or centralized, the whole set of information in the repository may be duplicated on every user’s system or may be maintained on a single server. The main purpose of a repository is to store a set of files, as well as the history of changes made to those files. Some of the metadata that a repository contains includes: a historical record of changes in the repository, a set of commit objects, and a set of references to commit objects, called heads.</p>
